//Ask the user to answer a single quiz question. Look for TODO 1.2a. Below the TODO comment, define variables called question, correctAnswer, and candidateAnswer.

//question should be initialized to the following string: "Who was the first American woman in space? ". Tip Note the trailing space at the end of this string is required. correctAnswer should be initialized to "Sally Ride". candidateAnswer will initially be set to the empty string.Find TODO 1.2b. Using your question variable, display the question and prompt the candidate for their answer. Store their response in one of the variables you defined just above. Under TODO 1.2c, check the candidate's answer to see if it is correct. Provide basic feedback to the candidate, letting them know if their answer is correct or not.Note Make sure your small app works properly before moving on to part 2. Part 2: Multiple QuestionsNow that your small app is working, expand it to deal with multiple questions. This time, you only have one TODO item in the starter code. You will need to determine which lines need to be modified. Define questions and correctAnswers variables as arrays. Use the table below to fill these arrays. Replace your code from TODO 1.2b with a loop that programmatically asks each question in the array and stores the user's responses. Replace the basic feedback from TODO 1.2c with a template literal that displays each of the candidate's responses in ad dition to the corresponding correct answers. Question	Answer Who was the first American woman in space?	"Sally Ride"  True or false: 5 kilometer == 5000 meters?	"true"  Given the array [8, 'Orbit', 'Trajectory', 45], what entry is at index 2?	"Trajectory" What is the minimum crew size for the ISS?	"3"//
